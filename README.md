# Cyber Security AI/ML Bootcamp Capstone Project

## Project Description

The assignment for this project was to create a machine learning classification algorithm to determine whether a URL is prone to phishing. The input dataset contained 11,000 samples, each corresponding to a URL. Each sample contained 32 features representing unique properties of the URL. Each feature had a value of -1 (phishing URL), 0 (suspicious URL), or 1 (legitimate URL).

The assignment was split into three parts. Part one was exploratory data analysis. Part two was feature selection, which involved detecting and removing correlated features. Part three was to build a classification model, illustrate its capabilities by plotting an ROC curve, and validate the data accuracy using K-Fold cross-validation. 

## Project Features

* The project was built in Python.
* Using a simple multi-layer perceptron model, a final F1-score of 0.85 was obtained for the training data, and a final F1-score of 0.86 was obtained for the test data.
